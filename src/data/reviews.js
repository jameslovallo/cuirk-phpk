			'Purple Heart Party Kids LLC is THE perfect birthday company because I didn‚Äôt have to lift a finger! They provided everything from the cake and decorations to the games and prizes! I had 40 kids at my party and they were all entertained all 5 hours. I never heard one kid say they were bored! It‚Äôs like they host the party! They don‚Äôt just set up and go they bring great energy and even get wet with the kids during the super soaker contest! I would recommend them to everyone! The prizes were great! The candy was great! Everything was amazing.',
