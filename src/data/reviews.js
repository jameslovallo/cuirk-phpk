      "Bounce House Kings LLC is THE perfect birthday company because I didn’t have to lift a finger! They provided everything from the cake and decorations to the games and prizes! I had 40 kids at my party and they were all entertained all 5 hours. I never heard one kid say they were bored! It’s like they host the party! They don’t just set up and go they bring great energy and even get wet with the kids during the super soaker contest! I would recommend them to everyone! The prizes were great! The candy was great! Everything was amazing.",

      "Thanks so much Bounce House Kings. My sons Bday Party Turned Out GREAT. I really enjoyed how professional everything was. The kids loved the Games, Sno Cones, Popcorn, and they even brought the Hot Dog Machine! Some of the kids even received prizes for the 1st place winners, which definitely put a smile on there faces. Watching the kids hit the Piñata was fun and everyone enjoyed the cake which was also included in the Platinum Package. Thanks Bounce House Kings! Book em Guys/Gals BOOK EM!",
