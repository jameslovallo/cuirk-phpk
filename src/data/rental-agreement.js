  <h3>Space Requirements &amp; Electrical</h3>
  <p>
    Please specify that the surface area the Bounce House will be on is flat and
    the type of surface as well such as grass, concrete or indoor.
  </p>
  <p>
    We recommend separate grounded outlets on dedicated 20 AMP circuits to power
    each blower that inflates the attraction. Most retractions only require one
    blower which runs continuously while the inflatable is in use.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, please be sure to specify the distance between the plug outlet to the
    Bounce House and whether or not the venue will need a generator.
  </p>
  <p>Additional fees will apply for use of generator.</p>
  <h3>Deliveries &amp; Weather</h3>
  <p>A $25 delivery fee may apply for distances greater than 15 miles.</p>
  <p>
    We reserve the right to arrive two hours prior to the rental setup time, and
    request up to two hours after the rental end time.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the customer you have up until the time we arrive at your party location
    to cancel due to weather conditions. Upon cancellation you will forfeit your
    non-refundable deposit. Once the attraction has been delivered and set up
    there are no refunds due to weather.
  </p>
  <h3>Misuse &amp; Damage</h3>
  <p>
    There should ALWAYS be an adult in direct supervision of the Inflatables at
    all times. The most important duties of an attendant are limiting the number
    of children in or on the Inflatable at one time, making sure that the
    children are all of similar size and controlling the behavior of all
    Participants. If you need someone to stay with the unit to supervise the
    kids, we can provide an attendant for a reasonable fee. To ensure the best
    experience for everyone, no food is permitted inside of the bounce houses.
    If any repair or replacement of our machines/equipment is necessary due to
    customer damage or abuse then the customer will be held financially
    responsible.
